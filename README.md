# Airbnb Analysis Overview
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

## Installation
### Packages
* Pandas
* Plotly
### Tools
* Tableau

## Motivation
I was interested in learning the best times to visit the city of Boston, based on the September 2016-September 2017 data.

The questions I answer during my analysis:

```
1. What times of the year are units listed the most expensive vs. the cheapest?
2. Which are the most expensive neighborhoods in Boston?
3. What are the busiest and least busiest times of the year?
```
## File Descriptions
* Airbnb Boston Analysis.ipynb is the notebook where I do my exploratory work, including creating data visualizations and taking a deeper look into the data
* The \*.csv files are the raw data files for all the Airbnb data

## Results
My Deeper analysis and results are posted on my [blog](https://sonalkarneil.medium.com/best-times-to-visit-boston-analyzing-pricing-and-availability-of-airbnb-units-127576d5d52f)
